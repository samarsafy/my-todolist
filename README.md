## 1. Introduction

#### this is an easy todoList built by react also with using a little JavaScript

## 2. Idea

#### the idea was to build a todolist React app, where you can asign the todos, delete them and search for the open and closed tasks.

## 3. install

#### so i installed the react app from the terminal and also the materialize to style the form of add todo. where i cloned a form from materialize and adjusted it to react.

`npm create react-app my-todolist`

`npm install react react-dom`

`npm install materialize-css@next`

#### the todo-list App is being renderd in terminal through the command

`npm run start`

#### the App had five components without the main component App.js where all components are being rendered. other components are CreatePost.jsx, Header.jsx, Post.jsx, PostList.jsx and SearchBar.

#### the index.js has a router, where i render the whole app from there
